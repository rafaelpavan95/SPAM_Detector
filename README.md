# SPAM Detector

### The purpose of this [project](https://github.com/rafaelpavan95/SPAM_Detector/blob/main/SPAM_Classifier.ipynb) is to build a detection system to classify messages as spam or legitimate. For this, we will develop a [Natural Language Processing Neural Network based in Embedding and LSTM layers](https://github.com/rafaelpavan95/SPAM_Detector/blob/main/RNN_NLP.py) using pytorch. Next, let's make a WordCloud to understand the more common expressions and words in messages classified as spam.
