# SPAM Detector

The purpose of this project is to build a detection system to classify messages as spam or legitimate. For this, we will use a Natural Language Processing Neural Network based in Embedding and LSTM layers. Next, let's make a WordCloud to understand the more common expressions and words in messages classified as spam.
